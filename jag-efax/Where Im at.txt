1. (done) Review code based on the notes taken with Kevin N recently. 

2. (In Progress) See if I can get the code running the way it presently is, locally first.

	- (Done) Create Basic POSTMAN request (See eFax local testing collection - legacy).
	
	- (Done) Execute a real request using the dev account.
	
	- (Done) Sort out issue when invoking the AEM (can see the outside world and hence need a local file available by URL).     
	
	- (Done) Sort out eFax connection issues from both accounts. 
		- JAG11_T cannot 'see' either fax.gov.bc.ca or squadron.gov.bc.ca 
		- jusefaxd can only see squadron. 
		
	- (Done) - Make sure Email Messages pulled from EmailServiceImpl: getInboxEmails() are pulled by received date in 
	  SortDirection.Ascending order.
	  
	  	Old is definitely ascending or der in fetch of new email.  
	  	Subject is text. 
	  	Body is html. 
	  
	- (Done) Try to fetch and parse an inbox item with the new impl using MS Graph.
	
			Recall that the new EmailMessage class needs the following attributes: 
			
					emailMessage.getSubject();
    				emailMessage.getBody()); <-- what format is this in HTML or ??
						a: String body = MessageBody.getStringFromMessageBody(emailMessage.getBody());   HTML STRING! 
					emailMessage.getId()  
					  	
	- (Done) See if each inbox item has an id. If so, add it to the GmailMessage for the deletion process.
	
	- (Done) - Begin process of updating send mail method in gService.
	- (Done) - Pull the poller enviro variables in to the MSG set. 
	- (Done) - Completely remove the exchange enviro variables.
	
	- (Done) - Document the set of new environmental variables for MS Graph API support. 
	- (TODO) - Work to get the code running with PROD account first as per Ryan's suggestion. 
	- (TODO) - Test prod fax service connectivity with new PROD account.
	- (TODO) - Fix test classes after pulling EWS library.
