 (Done) Review code based on the notes taken with Kevin N recently. 
 (Done) See if I can get the code running the way it presently is, locally first.
 (Done) Create Basic POSTMAN request (See eFax local testing collection - legacy).
 (Done) Execute a real request using the dev account.
 (Done) Sort out issue when invoking the AEM (can see the outside world and hence need a local file available by URL).     
 (Done) Sort out eFax connection issues from both accounts. 
		- JAG11_T cannot 'see' either fax.gov.bc.ca or squadron.gov.bc.ca 
		- jusefaxd can 'see' squadron but response template is wrong - no guid and job id present.  
 (Done) - Make sure Email Messages pulled from EmailServiceImpl: getInboxEmails() are pulled by received date in SortDirection.Ascending order.
	  
	  	Old EWS is definitely ascending order when fetching new email.  
	  	Subject is text. 
	  	Body is html. 
 (Done) Try to fetch and parse an inbox item with the new impl using MS Graph.
	
			Recall that the new EmailMessage class needs the following attributes: 
			
					emailMessage.getSubject();
    				emailMessage.getBody()); <-- what format is this in HTML or ??
						a: String body = MessageBody.getStringFromMessageBody(emailMessage.getBody());   HTML STRING! 
					emailMessage.getId()  
					  	
 (Done) See if each inbox item has an id. If so, add it to the GmailMessage for the deletion process.
