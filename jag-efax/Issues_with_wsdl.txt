When importing the wsdl from http://localhost:8080/ws/DocumentDistributionMainProcess.wsdl, Soap-UI gave me constants problems. 

When I attempted to import with POSTMAN, this is what was provided back: 

"The specified document has no bindings or operations, the items were not created."

What I did to get around this was build a proxy client jar and import it into a small project to generate a soap request and
capture it from membrane. I then created a proper SOAP request in POSTMAN to exercise the sending of a request.
